Problem Statement

You are given an array of nn integers and qq queries. Each query consists of two integers l,rl,r and asks for the sum of the subarray from index ll to rr (1-based index).
Input

    The first line contains two integers n,qn,q (size of the array and number of queries).
    The second line contains nn space-separated integers (array elements).
    The next qq lines contain two integers l,rl,r.

Output

    Print the sum of elements from index ll to rr for each query.
