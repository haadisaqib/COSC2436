1. Which statement best describes how recursion works in a C++ function?  
*a) Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself until a base condition is reached, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.  
b) Recursion is a mechanism that automatically implements infinite loops in a program, eliminating the need for conditional statements.  
c) Recursion is the only method for iterating through large data sets, as loops are not allowed in modern C++ compilers.  
d) Recursion guarantees constant time complexity by repeatedly creating and destroying function stacks.

  
2. Open addressing in a hash table requires storing linked lists at each index to resolve collisions.  
a) True  
*b) False

  
3. Complete the function to reverse a queue using a stack:  
* Use a stack to pop all elements from the queue, then enqueue those elements back to the queue.

  
4. In a binary tree, each node can have up to how many children?  
* 2

  
5. When building a max-heap from an unsorted array, which step is performed first?  
a) Swap the first and last elements of the array  
*b) Heapify from the lowest non-leaf node up to the root  
c) Insert elements one by one into an initially empty heap  
d) Perform an in-order traversal to locate parent nodes

  
6. In evaluating a postfix expression with a stack, we always pop exactly two operands before applying an operator.  
*a) True  
b) False

  
7. Shell sort can be seen as a generalization of which simpler sorting algorithm?  
* Insertion Sort

  
8. Direct hashing uses the ________ itself as the address in the hash table.  
* key

  
9. Which of the following steps is NOT part of a typical Merge Sort algorithm in C++?  
a) Recursively split the array into halves until subarrays contain one element or no element.  
*b) Sort each smaller subarray by only swapping adjacent elements in a loop.  
c) Merge the sorted subarrays by comparing elements and building a new sorted sequence.  
d) Recursively combine these subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

  
10. In linear probing, if the initial position h(key) is taken, the next position to check is computed as h(key) + ________.  
* 1

  
11. A priority queue that uses a min-heap will always serve the element with the highest value first.  
a) True  
*b) False

  
12. Suppose the primary hash is h1(key). Write the secondary hash h2(key) = (prime number < tableSize) - (key % prime number) for double hashing, where tableSize is the size of the hash table.  
* (prime number < tableSize) - (key % prime number)

  
13. Which of the following best describes the average time complexity of quick sort?  
a) O(n)  
*b) O(n * log n)  
c) O(n^2)  
d) O(log n)

  
14. In a max-heap’s heapify process, if a node violates the max-heap property, it is swapped with its larger child and heapify continues recursively.  
*a) True  
b) False

  
15. Radix sort processes integers digit by digit, beginning with the ________ significant digit.  
* least

  
16. When inserting the keys 5, 2, 7 into an empty AVL tree (in that order), the root node after all insertions is ________.  
* 5

  
17. In an in-order traversal (Left, Root, Right), which node is visited last for a non-empty binary tree?  
a) The root node  
b) The leftmost node  
*c) The right subtree’s rightmost node  
d) The left subtree’s leftmost node

  
18. In bucket sort, elements are separated into different buckets and then ________ within each bucket before recombining them.  
* sorted

  
19. The balance factor of an AVL node is defined as (height of right subtree) – (height of left subtree).  
a) True  
*b) False

  
20. In a recursive function to find the height of a binary tree, the base case occurs when the current node is ________.  
* bode left and right are nullptr
